        <p>
          What is RevolutionUC? RevolutionUC is a student hackathon in which we invite students from across the midwest to partake in a weekend of code, community, and self-improvement. You don't have to attend the University of Cincinnati and you don't have to be a computer science major or engineering student. We're looking for people who share our passion to do awesome things with technology.

        <h2> What are we about?</h2>
        <p>
          Hackathons are more than just a competition or showcase of technical skill. At RevolutionUC, we strive to create an all-inclusive community that acts as an outlet in which we can join our peers and share our passion for all the incredible things that can be done through programming. Weâ€™re excited to share this ethos with all of our attendees and come together to grow the hacker community here in Cincinnati.
